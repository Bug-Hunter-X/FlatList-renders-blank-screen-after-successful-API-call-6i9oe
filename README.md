# React Native FlatList Blank Screen Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Native where a FlatList component renders a blank screen after a successful API call, despite having proper loading and error handling in place.  The issue arises from data not being properly processed and rendered after a successful API fetch. The `DataFetch.js` file contains the buggy code, whereas the `DataFetchSolution.js` demonstrates a way to fix this issue.

## Problem

The provided `DataFetch` component fetches data from a public API and handles loading and error states correctly. However, after successful data retrieval the FlatList doesn't render any of the fetched data.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the fetched data is correctly structured and handled within the `renderItem` function and that appropriate keys are provided for each item for efficient rendering. The `DataFetchSolution.js` provides a detailed and clear implementation of the corrected code.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios` to start the app.

You will observe that the initial `DataFetch.js` will only show a blank screen, even if the API call was successful. After reviewing and implementing the changes in `DataFetchSolution.js`, the list should correctly render data from the API.
